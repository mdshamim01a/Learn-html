    <p>
        A fictional character biography, or character bio, is a detailed overview of a fictional person's life, covering everything from their name and appearance to their personality, backstory, and relationships. It can be used by authors and role-players to develop a character, ensure consistency, and help others understand the character before a narrative begins. A full-fledged character biography might delve into their history, motivations, and traits, while a shorter version used for introductions focuses on key descriptive details.
